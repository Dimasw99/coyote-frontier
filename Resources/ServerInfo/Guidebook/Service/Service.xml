# Service
[color=#9fed58]Service[/color] keeps the station clean, efficient and sane so that all other departments can do their jobs better and keep their staff happy. They also end up doing most of the paperwork on the station.

## The Big Five: Aerofex
Comfort. Hospitality. Station and ship design. Aerofex is sleek and fast, they bring the 'chic' to 'ships' - for a price of course. To boot, Aerofex has a vicegrip on the service industry in the sector with zero intent on changing that anytime soon. Luxury is nice, but the average person really just needs somewhere to sleep and a food truck to eat at - consistent business for Aerofex.

Aerofex isn't as large or as staffed as NanoTrasen, but their near religious research into sleep patterns and ergonomics leads them to stamp out the competition from ever getting fierce.

If you see a station or a ship with those signature, decadent, Titanium (white) walls; you know who's had a gilded hand.

Most [color=#9fed58]Service[/color] jobs require [color=#a4885c]cooperation[/color] between workers.
Chefs often need ingredients that only botanists can grow efficiently. The bartender may request bananas that only clowns carry in abundance.
The lawyer may invite the mime to play charades to convince the judge that their client is innocent.

A lot of [color=#a4885c]collaboration[/color] is necessary within and without [color=#9fed58]Service[/color]. Often times, [color=#9fed58]Service[/color] is required by other departments, so be on your toes.
