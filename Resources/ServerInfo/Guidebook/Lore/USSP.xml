# The USSP
Conceived in the struggle against the Trans-Solar Federation's overarching and pro-corporate unity, the Union of Soviet Socialist Planets is the single largest splinter faction of humanity. Following the tenets of Malfoy Ames, the Union serves as a striking contrast to the staunch corporatism rife in human sectors. Collectivist in nature, the USSP espouses that the well-being of many is better served through collective ownership and broad governance rather than by the individual or the corporation.
