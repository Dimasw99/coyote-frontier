# The Trans Solar Federation.
The Trans-Solar Federation, also known as the TSF, SolGov, or simply the Federation, is the largest human-majority nation and de-facto superpower of the Orion Arm. Headquartered on Earth, the TSF is a unitary federal democracy in which only those who have performed a requisite five years of national service may vote or hold public office. Militaristic, assertive, and egalitarian, the Federation is a political chimera that has served as a bastion of capitalism and controlled liberty for centuries. With the strongest economy, industrial base, and armed forces in the known Sector, the TSF is a beacon of stability and power for all under its aegis.
