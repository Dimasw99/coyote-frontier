  # Harpies

  ### Homeworld
  Unknown

  ### Temperment
  Harpies tend to be chatty, incredibly so.  Often speaking in broken sentences that they pause or fire off like staccato notes. They also tend to be a bit on the argumentative side, possibly - some believe - just to hear the sound of their own voice.

  ### Secondary Species of Interest
  Felinids - Harpies love Felinids, they love the faces they make and the noises they make and how cute their ears are and - and - and - suffice it to say this occasional total infuation that some Harpies have for Felinids tends to go over a bit poorly
  for the other species, especially if the affection isn't returned.

  Resomi - The small birdlike Resomi often trigger two extreme responses in some Harpies.  Either large amounts of cute aggression or absolute disgust.  Sometimes it can even change from day to day.

  Harpy - Yes, Harpies often have issues with themselves. Two harpies meeting can cause - on occasion - a Murder.  Which is what happens when two harpies disagree on a topic but can't stop talking about it because they both enjoy the lively debate.

  An avian humanoid species that features colorful feathered wings and tails that can mimic almost any sound.

  They are quite sensitive to the air quality, and when exposed to low quality air, they will begin to visibly gasp, and eventually start choking.
  When this happens, a Harpy should either move away from sources of bad air, stand on top of a scrubber for a few seconds, or take a few breaths from a pure oxygen tank in order to restore their blood-oxygen levels. Only three seconds of being on pure oxygen is enough to completely restore a Harpy's blood oxygen saturation.

  ## Diet

  - Can eat raw meat.

  ## Benefits

  - Somewhat smaller than Humans, although not as small as Felinids
  - Uses their talons to deal Piercing damage
  - Can imitate around 70% of the game's sound library through a huge list of voice emotes
  - They can "Sing" midis by imitating instruments. Right click yourself to select an instrument

  ## Special

  - Comes with the Ultraviolet Vision trait by default. This can be disabled via accessibility options.
  - Cannot wear Jumpsuits, and will automatically start with a Jumpskirt instead.
  - While singing, musical notes appear floating around their head.

  ## Drawbacks

  - Takes 15% more Blunt, Slash, and Piercing damage.
  - Extreme low density, Harpies are lighter than even Felinids, and weigh half as much as a Human.
  - A Harpy breathes in air twice as often as Humans, inhaling and exhaling every 3 seconds.
  - - Air tanks last half as long and Harpies are more susceptible than usual to low air quality.
  - - If a Harpy is exposed to at least 0.2 moles of combined CO2 and/or Miasma, they start struggling to take in oxygen.
