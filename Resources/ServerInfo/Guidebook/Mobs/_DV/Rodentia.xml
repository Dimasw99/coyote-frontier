  # Rodentia

  ### Homeworld
  Unknown, assumed Sol

  ### Temperment
  Rodentia tend to trend towards the shy, the quiet, and the unassuming.  Many are seen as anxious, nervous, or just generally flighty.  Despite that they are - when comfortable - close kept friends who seem
  to lack a real understanding of personal space or have tendencies to horde materials.

  ### Secondary Species of Interest
  Felinids - Most rodentia are scared of Felinids to a degree.  Feeling easily flustered by the larger - seemingly predatory - humanoids.  The rare exception occurs at times though where a Rodentia will be overly attentive to a Felinid - often causing confusion.

  Resomi - A sort of kinship exists between the Resomi and Rodentia.  The two small and quiet species finding peace in each others presence - including a desire to hold onto everything they can.

  Feroxi - Many Rodentia look up to the Feroxi they know, fascinated by the Feroxi's pride and attitudes.  Quietly they attempt to emulate them, hoping that they aren't noticed.
