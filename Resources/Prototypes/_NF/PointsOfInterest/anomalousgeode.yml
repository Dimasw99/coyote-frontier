# ^ buddy. this shit lets you eschew player interaction for desireable, *optional* in round upgrades.
# a lack of science ships is a lowpop issue - but Frontier's design philosophy made it where you can do your job and turn a profit without their help.
# even if you bought a science ship, you would still be worse off;
# because the geode is designed in such a way that incredibly limits the amount of damage the anomalies can do.

# I can't blame you.
# this game dev shit is hard.
# I am sealing this evil away to never return.
