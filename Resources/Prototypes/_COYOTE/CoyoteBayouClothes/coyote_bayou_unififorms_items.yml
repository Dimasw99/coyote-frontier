    many years until they gave up and rejoined Nash in the Great Merger, shortly before
    everything fell apart and everyone died.

    A set of ragged clothes 'inspired' by the beggars of the Coyote Bayou.
    Back in the Bayou, those who couldn't afford the steep prices of the Nash Workshop's
    ammo vendors would often trade their sexual services for equipment, protection, and further
    sexual services. Often by the end of the day, their clothes would be in tatters,
    and its not uncommon to see a beggar walking around in nothing but their underwear,
    or a collar and leash.

    ineffective armor, and a pair of pants that could be tucked into your boots to keep out the
    newts. The Bloodshot Gang were notoriously bad shots, and often relied on the fact that the
    wasteland would revive them if they died, leading to bleeding more than actually being a threat.

    A poignant black tee and blue skirt, as recorded as a casual style for a couple weeks in the Coyote Bayou.
    Skirts were a popular fashion choice for Nash and New Boston's townsfolk, and this one is no exception.
    Archaeologists argue that the skirt's popularity was due to quick access to the wearer's business end,
    but the truth was that there was a widespread obesity epidemic in the Coyote Bayou, and skirts were simply
    the most comfortable option for those who were too bottom-heavy to wear pants.

    with their cleaning prowess. They were known as the Blue Sun Maids, dutifully cleaning out all manner of
    bodily fluids from the numerous dorm rooms and apartments in the area. Without their noble efforts, the
    rental market would have collapsed under a literal tide of cum. And now you can wear their cum-resistant
    maid dress, perfect for bathing in cum like you do every Tuesday.

    fringe fashion of the Coyote Bayou's Desperate For Breeding subculture, who would often wear provocative
    outfits to attract attention and get bred by anyone who would take them. This eventually turned into every
    other person, and the subculture just became culture.

    A traditional cheong sam, styled after a popular fashion of the Coyote Bayou's townsfolk.
    This cheong sam is made of a light, breathable fabric that is perfect for the Coyote Bayou's

    stylish enough to turn heads. The cheong sam is a symbol of the Coyote Bayou's rich cultural heritage,
    a mismash of countless worlds bluespaced into one. This one is white, symbolizing the purity of the
    Coyote Bayou's townsfolk before they were all dicked down by the Event. This one has black shorts,
    because those are cute as heck.

    died, it was a great learning experience for everyone involved, since the lands revived them all
    and showed that this world revives people for some reason. Some say he never wore this outfit,
    but still the style lives on through dorms room roleplay.

    rampant obesity epidemic that throughout the height of Nash and New Boston's history. While the corset
    did little to hide their blubbery guts, it did help accentuate their fatness, because people really liked
    fat people back then, especially the two vixens who lived there, Dan and Sam Kelly, who were fat as hell
    and the sexiest creatures in the Coyote Bayou. The stitches creak in anticipation of your figure.

    with the revealing nature of a billowing dress. Goes great with a cottagecore aesthetic, and is perfect for
    those who want to just be left alone from the rampant horniness inherent to the Coyote Bayou. While the
    populace of the Coyote Bayou were known for their promiscuity, there was no shame in keeping to oneself,
    or even just being platonically affectionate with friends. This dress is a symbol of that, and is sure to
    maintain the wearer's modesty while still being comfortable enough to wear all day.

    and plunging neckline make a very bold statement about the wearer's sexual prowess. Utterly
    useless for anything other than making a grand entrance, those who wear this gown don't need to

    It is very stretchy, and designed to accommodate the wearer's enormous curves, while still being

    once the populace realized it looked great on obese vixens. The Hiveblob was very happy that its

  name: blood red formal dress
  description: |
    Unrelated to modern day Syndicate fashion, this blood red formal dress is a throwback to the
    Coyote Bayou's early days, when often the townsfolk would be too covered in blood to look good in
    their formal wear. This dress is designed to be both stylish and practical, with a flowing skirt
    and a fitted bodice that flatters the wearer's figure. The blood red color would later be adopted
    by the Coyote Bayou's townsfolk as a symbol of their resilience and strength, and was a popular
    choice for formal events and gatherings.

  name: fox flannel
  description: |
    A cozy flannel shirt, styled after the popular fashion of the Coyote Bayou's foxes. While the bayou was
    often hot and humid, the wild dimensional leakage from the surrounding worlds bluespaced into one
    caused the weather to be unpredictable, and there were often cold snaps that would leave the
    residents of the Coyote Bayou shivering in their boots. Foxes, being the sexiest creatures in the bayou,
    were often seen wearing flannel shirts to keep warm, and this shirt is a tribute to that fashion.

  description: |
    A luxurious golden dress, designed to exude an air of wealth and opulence that only the richest
    townsfolk of the Coyote Bayou could afford. This dress is made of a shimmering golden fabric that
    catches the light beautifully. This was back when gold was a rare and valuable resource, and
    the skill needed to weave it into clothing was a closely guarded secret. Nowadays you can't go
    two steps without tripping over a bunch of gold, and thus this dress is about as expensive as a
    pack of smokes. It is also very uncomfortable, being made from literal metal.

    A dark, gothic dress, styled after the popular fashion of the Coyote Bayou's raccoons. While the
    raccoons weren't actually goths, the monochrome color scheme and the flowing design of the dress,
    combined with the heavy use of lace, fringes, and fishnet, made it a popular choice for these folk,
    as it worked well with their natural fur patterns and colors. It was also sexy as hell, and raccoons
    loved to be sexy, so this dress was a perfect fit for them.

    A lighter gray Victorian gothic dress, styled after the popular fashion of the Coyote Bayou's raccoons.
    While the raccoons weren't actually goths, the monochrome color scheme and the flowing design of the dress,
    combined with the heavy use of lace, fringes, and fishnet, made it a popular choice for these folk,
    as it worked well with their natural fur patterns and colors. The Great Eastern Hiveblob, which was
    responsible for the majority of the Coyote Bayou's fashion, made this dress as a lighter alternative to
    the original gothic dress, upsized to accommodate the growing population of obese raccoons in the bayou.
    As it was sexy and fit quite well, it soon phased out the original gothic dress.

    to be worn with an equipment harness, and had a skirt to both catch the cooling wind, and allow quick
    access to the wearer's business end. As the plains were fairly peaceful, the vixens who lived there
    often passed the time with lewd roleplay, and this dress was designed to be both cute and practical,
    with a flowing skirt and a fitted bodice that flatters the wearer's figure. The 'seven' in the name has
    no known connection to the Great Eastern Hiveblob.

    burdened by the oppressive humidity and heat of the Coyote Bayou. Since geckos are not native to the
    sector, the leather is just some useless plastic that offers no protection at all, but it does show off
    your chest and hips, so it is still effective at hunting for tail.

    A forest green landschneckt, a fancy formal outfit that was popular among the early days of the
    Coyote Bayou's expansion into Nash. While it saw little use in the actual exploration parties,
    it was popularized by the Boxcar Vixens, who for whatever reason found it to be a sexy outfit
    and would often seduce wearers of this outfit on the long train rides through the Continental
    Heap. It became popular travel wear by those who wanted to bed a Boxcar Vixen, and trust me,
    everyone did, as they were the hottest vixens in the Coyote Bayou.

    clothing that would fit the growing population of obese furries in the Coyote Bayou. The latex material is
    stretchy and form-fitting, both containing and reshaping the wearer's fat into something more practical
    for daily life, while also being modified to be breathable and comfortable in the humid bayou climate.
    It was common to see the latex singlet worn under a loose-fitting shirt or jacket, along with a pair of
    compression pants, to prevent excessive jiggling and chafing.

    While the DEATHKILLARZ were known for their brutality and violence, they were also known for their
    distinctive fashion sense, which would go on to inspire the Great Eastern Hiveblob into never making
    anything like this again. The loincloth is lined with teeth, designed to make accessing ones business end
    unpleasant for all involved, and the shawl is sure to give anyone a rash. As a modern recreation, the
    skulls and teeth have been replaced with plastic replicas, though the authentic unpleasantness remains.

    new cultures was a faux-Egyptian culture, amounting to a dozen or so vixens who dressed up in

    A red landschneckt, a fancy formal outfit that was popular among the early days of the
    Coyote Bayou's expansion into Nash. While it saw little use in the actual exploration parties,
    it was popularized by the Boxcar Vixens, who for whatever reason found it to be a sexy outfit
    and would often seduce wearers of this outfit on the long train rides through the Continental
    Heap. It became popular travel wear by those who wanted to bed a Boxcar Vixen, and trust me,
    everyone did, as they were the hottest vixens in the Coyote Bayou.

    A radkini, which despite the name, refers to the radiation inherent to the beaches of the Coyote Bayou,
    rather than the bikini itself. While the bikini offers no protection against radiation, it is actually
    designed to focus the radiation into the sensitive areas of the wearer's body, allowing them to
    absorb dangerous levels of radiation, likely for sexual purposes. While irradiating your genitals is a
    very bad idea, it is speculated that since one could recover from any injury through a temporary death,
    residents were able to find some kind of enjoyment in this practice. Please keep away from radiation,
    you will die and leave a very unsexy corpse.

    Nash for the zillionth time, a scar in the land where the forces from beyond would repair the damage
    and return life to the giblets formed from the destruction, a reminder that life will always never
    truly end, and that the Coyote Bayou will always be a place of rebirth and renewal. Even now, as an abandoned
    wasteland, the world is never truly dead, simply in a form, waiting for its time to be reborn again.

    family, a sweet treat that would bring everyone together and remind them of the joys of life, even in the

    that it was a gorgeous place, just that the builders had a disagreement, also the tribal sector was literally
    under the stairs like some kind of forgotten crawl space, and that the walls were painted yellow to
    hide all the piss stains.

    A colorful tribalwear top, designed to be worn by the Coyote Bayou's tribal residents who wanted something
    simple and comfortable to wear, even in the hot summer heat. The Sulphur Bottom tribal coalition of
    nature lovers were a major facet of Coyote Bayou's culture, despite only being a couple of people who
    ever showed up to do anything. And these clothes are colorful, symbolizing something.

  description: |
    A drab uniform, designed from a mashup of old tired military uniforms that were at one point stylish
    but is now just a sad reminder of the Coyote Bayou's past. The sad part was that of all the uniforms
    bluespaced into the Coyote Bayou, they all looked very drab and sad, and few were designed to fit with
    the general fashion of the Coyote Bayou, which is to say, quick to remove and easy to flip up.

  description: |
    A pair of drab green trousers, perfect for going shirtless in the Coyote Bayou's snakewaters and
    showing off your assets. The trousers are made of a stretchy, breathable material that allows for easy
    movement, and, of course, easy access to the wearer's business end. The suspenders ensure that no matter
    how awful it gets, this thing will always have your back.

    pseudotraditionalisticists who wanted something both non-showy and unrevealing, yet still
    able to be flipped up in the back and rutted mercilessly if need be. While it comes from a
    Victorian inspiration, the light flowing fabric was optimized to be as little of a hindrance
    to one's hinder as possible, cutely.

    many moons would occasionally hide behind the clouds, leaving the residents in darkness,
    which was nice, since most of the monsters were afraid of the dark.

    uptight and prim pseudotraditionalisticists who wanted something both non-showy and unrevealing,
    and also something that wasn't a dress at all, integrating the use of pants and a vest to make
    something practical and attractive, though it lacked certain features that would allow for
    easy access to the wearer's business end. The red shirt symbolizes the crimson red skies that
    would form from the burning fallout assets that the world once purged into space at some point,
    as though the world just suddenly rejected a longstanding facet of the world. It was for good
    reason, since all that stuff was making the world suck and all the people annoying.

    which was usually just a couple of clams or some cherry pie.

    accident when someone put an anomalous red hat into the communal laundromat and made all the black
    dresses red, which was a happy accident, as red is more associated with the Coyote Bayou's
    cherry pie, a sweet treat that would bring everyone together and remind them of the joys of life,
    despite the fact that the cherry pie was actually a lie, and was just a cover for
    the Coyote Bayou's secret pie smuggling operation, which was a major source of
    income for the town's residents, and also a major source of conflict with the neighboring towns
    who wanted a piece of the pie, but were never able to get it, because the
    Coyote Bayou's residents were too clever and resourceful to let anyone else in on
    their secret pie smuggling operation. [citation needed]

    Annoying Dye Incident of Smarch 32nd, where a group of vixens accidentally dyed all their
    clothes red, and it became a fashion trend that lasted for a couple of weeks before everyone
    got bored of it and went back to their usual black and white outfits.

    Gary, a notorious citizen who wore this shirt everywhere he went, and some people even
    started calling it the 'Gary shirt', which was a bit of a misnomer, since the shirt
    was actually designed by a group of vixens who wanted to create something that was both
    practical and stylish, and the 'rusty eggplant' color was just a happy accident
    that happened when they accidentally spilled some dye on the shirt while they were
    trying to create a new color for the shirt.

    catboys who wanted something both stylish and practical, yet still able to be flipped up in the back
    and rutted mercilessly if need be. While it comes from a Victorian inspiration, the breakaway trousers
    were more of a recent innovation, appearing on other such fashions of the time, such as 'vestsuits',
    later becoming phased out in favor for skirts and dresses, which were more practical for the daily usage
    of those who wear them.

  name: westender slingsuit
  description: |
    A westender slingsuit, as worn by the Coyote Bayou's West Enders, a group of wolves who originally settled the
    peri-redwater swampranches where much of the wide horses were bred and raised. The slingsuit is designed to be
    repellent of the swamp's many insects, to the point where its use became so common that several species of
    furry-feeding insects were driven to extinction, leading to the collapse of the Redwater ecosystem and the
    eventual rise of the Coyote Bayou's nanoflora, which seeped into the watertable and made it safe to drink.
    It is called a slingsuit due to a common mutation in the Coyote Bayou's wolves, which caused their
    genitals to become elongated and slung down between their legs, prompting the use of a special
    sling to keep them from dragging on the ground and getting dirty. [citation needed]

  description: |
    A western bustle dress, worn by the many cowgirls of the Coyote Bayou's western ranches, who wanted something
    that would accommodate their naturally enormous assets while still being comfortable and practical.
    The bustle is named as such because of the daily 'bustle' of the typical cowgirl, which typically involved
    a lot of bending over and reaching for things, which would cause the bustle to 'bustle' around and
    make it difficult to walk, which this outfit helps with. It is also designed to connect to various brands of
    milking machines, some of which still in use to this day, though not currently on this dress.

  name: white bunnysuit
  description: |
    A white bunnysuit, designed in stark protest to the Heaven's Night's previous 'bunny suit', which gave an
    unrealistic and untrue portrayal of the Coyote Bayou's bunnies, depicting them as hypersexualized and
    objectified, rather than the cute and cuddly creatures they are. While it, like the previous bunnysuit,
    is designed to be quick to remove and easy to flip up, it is also designed to provide a more accurate
    caricature of the lagomorphic residents, emphasizing their natural curves and softness, as well as including
    many hardpoints for armoring and weaponry, as while bunnies are cute and cuddly, they will also insist they
    are the most dangerous creatures in the Coyote Bayou, and will not hesitate to prove it if you cross them.
    One such bunny was in charge of the trade depot and wielded a couple laser blasters that the town universally
    agreed was unfair, which made sense, as she was the only one who could actually use them without accidentally
    shooting herself in the foot, which was a common problem with the Coyote Bayou's bunny population,
    since their feet are so large and floppy that they often trip over themselves and accidentally
    shoot themselves in the foot, which is why the bunnies are so dangerous, because they are always
    accidentally shooting themselves in the foot, and then they get mad and start shooting at everything else
    around them. [citation needed]

    allows for easy movement, and, of course, easy access to the wearer's business end. The white gown was
    popularized by the Coyote Bayou's nightlife scene, where it was often worn by dancers and performers who
    wanted to show off their curves while still being comfortable and practical. As with most of the Coyote Bayou's clothing,
    it is designed to be quick to remove and easy to flip up, allowing for easy access to the wearer's business end.

    A white sun dress, designed to repel the harsh rays of the Coyote Bayou's sun, which can be quite intense
    during the nuclear summer months. Though it appears as a simple white dress, it is actually the peak of
    fashion technology from circa 2nd Era Nash, integrating a special nanoflora that would soak up the gross
    bodily effluvia from being fluffy furries in a literal swamp, then convert it into a breathable pleasant
    exudate that would keep the town from smelling like wet dog and swamp gas. While it, too, was designed to be
    quick to remove and easy to flip up, it was also designed to be comfortable and practical to wear at all times,
    due to the aforementioned dogstink problem.

  description: |
    As the Coyote Bayou's residents were, for the most part, furries, clothes were not strictly necessary for
    day to day life, and many residents preferred to go without them. While this was fine for most of the
    residents, daily life required one to carry around various items, such as tools, weapons, and their
    Guild Questbook, largely for convenience and survival. As such the Great Eastern Hiveblob developed a
    nigh-invisible harness that would allow the wearer to carry around an ID and a couple of items in their
    pockets, providing a convenient way to carry around their belongings while still being very much naked.
    It was the pinnacle of fashion technology from the Coyote Bayou, and even today, nudists will wear this
    harness to live out their naked dreams, both safely and practically. Go Nude Today!
